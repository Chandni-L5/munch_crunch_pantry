# 📚 Epics

The project has been designed around a set of epics, representing the core functionality of this e-commerce platform. Each epic is broken down into smaller units - user stories - to clearly identify and organise the needs and objectives of the potential and returning customers as well as the site owners/administrators. The success of the goals will be measured using acceptance criteria.

The Epics have been split into a number of key themes:

## 🔐 User Account & Authentication
