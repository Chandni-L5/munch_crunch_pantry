### Agile Development & Planning 
#### User Stories
The development and the planning of this project has been created with the Agile methodologies in mind throughout.

Epics have been condensed to bitesize user stories.

[📚 The epics can be viewed here](/documentation/epics.md)

[📓 The user stories can be viewed here](/documentation/user-stories.md)

#### Estimation
I have used the MoSCoW method to prioritize the user stories into Must have, Should have, Could have and Won't have for this project. These categories are also represented on the KanBan board, with coloured labels for easy reference by the development team. At the start of the project, 'Won't have' items will not be applied, but this will be reviewed at the end of the project for potential future implementations depending on the progress made. 

To support the estimation, I have also used story points based on a Fibonacci methodology to estimate the effort required for each user story. This allows for a more accurate assessment of the complexity and time needed for implementation and helps to guide prioritization and ordering of tasks during the development process.

- **Should Have:** 19 story points  
- **Could Have:** 20 story points  

**Total:** **107 story points** (including Could Have features)

---

## Planning Rationale

During the planning stages, the MoSCoW priorities were distributed as **56% Must have**, **20% Should have**, and **24% Could have**.  
The total number of story points estimated for the project was **107**, including the Could have features.

This distribution aligns with Agile best practice and reflects the requirements of an e-commerce MVP, where authentication, product management, basket functionality, and secure checkout are essential for a viable product.

The implementation and prioritization of user stories as well as the acceptance criteria is recorded and tracked dynamically through the use of GitHub Projects Kanban board. The Kanban board records the user story, acceptance criteria and tasks. These are checked off as we progress through the project. 

Each issue recorded on the Kanban board has been assigned multiple labels depending on the MoSCoW priority and the epic it belongs to. This allows for easy tracking and filtering of tasks for the development team.

- Users & Profile
- Catalogue Products
- Content/ Brand
- Orders & Checkout
- Engagement 

#### ERD
The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) below illustrates the relationships between the main entities in the Munch Crunch Pantry database. It shows how users, products, orders, and other related data are interconnected.

![ERD Diagram](/documentation/images/erd.png)

#### Relational Data Model
The relational data model for Munch Crunch Pantry is structured to support the e-commerce functionality of the website. PostgreSQL has been used as the database management system to implement the relational model in production.

The model is designed to handle various standard aspects of an e-commerce platform, such as user accounts, products catalog, reviews, shopping cart, orders, and payment processing. The relationships between tables are established using foreign keys to ensure data integrity and consistency whilst also reducing duplication of data

Some additional features that have been incorporated into the relational data model include:
- Nutritional information for products
- Product origin stories
- Customer reviews and ratings
- Newsletter subscriptions
- Discount codes and promotions
- Detailed order history
- Customer support history

#### Database Schema
The database schema for Munch Crunch Pantry is designed to efficiently store and manage data related to products, users, orders, and other relevant information. The schema follows a relational database model, ensuring data integrity and consistency. 

The schema includes primary keys for each table to uniquely identify records, as well as foreign keys to establish relationships between tables. This design allows for efficient querying and data retrieval, supporting the e-commerce functionality of the website.

##### Category → Product (1-to-many)
- A category can have multiple products, but each product belongs to only one category.
- Category uses a unique slug for clean, SEO friendly URLS
- Product has foreign key reference to Category

##### Product sizes and pricing (many-to-many)
- A product can have multiple sizes, and each size can be associated with multiple products.
- Each individual product size has its own price - Implemented through an intermediary table ProductQuantity that links products to their available sizes and prices.
- ProductQuantity has foreign key references to both Product and Quantity tables.

##### Product → NutritionLabel (1-to-1)
- Each product has one associated nutrition label, and each nutrition label corresponds to one product.
- Product has a foreign key reference to NutritionLabel.
- NutritionLabel contains multiple nutrition metrics (e.g., calories, fat, protein) stored in a separate NutritionMetric table.
- The separation between NutritionLabel and NutritionMetric allows for flexibility in adding or modifying nutrition metrics without altering the product table structure.

##### Review → Product/User (many-to-1)
- A product can have multiple reviews, and a user can write multiple reviews, but each review is associated with only one product and one user.
- Review has foreign key references to both Product and User tables.
- `rating_avg` and `rating_count` fields in Product table to store average rating and total number of reviews for quick access - particularly useful for displaying ratings on product listing pages.

##### User profile and customer contact messages
- Each user has one associated profile, and each profile corresponds to one user.
- User has a foreign key reference to Profile.
- Profile contains additional user information such as phone number and address.
- Contact messages are linked to users through a foreign key reference in the ContactMessage table.

##### OrderLineItem and Orders (checkout)
- An order line item represents a specific product and quantity within an order - Links to foreign keys for both Order and ProductQuantity.
- An order can have multiple line items, but each line item belongs to only one order.
- Order has foreign key reference to User.
- various details related to payment and shipping are stored in the Order table - linked to a single user as well as costing details, Stripe reference and basket snapshot.
- An order can have multiple line items, but each line item belongs to only one order.

##### Discounts
- Discount codes are stored in a separate Discount table, which includes fields for code, email of the user it is assigned to/email and order minimums.
- Discounts can be applied to orders during checkout, with the discount code linked to the Order table through a foreign key reference.

##### Newsletter Subscriptions
- Newsletter subscriptions are managed through a separate NewsletterSubscription table, which includes fields for email and subscription status.
- This is designed independently from the User table to allow for non-registered users to subscribe to the newsletter.


##### Origin Stories - Content Marketing 
- Origin stories are stored in a separate OriginStory table, which includes fields for title, content and origin country.
- Each origin story can be linked to multiple products, establishing a many-to-many relationship through an intermediary table ProductOriginStory that links products to their associated origin stories.

#### Summary 
- All tables have been designed with appropriate data types and constraints to ensure data integrity and consistency with the use of a numeric Primary Key. 
- Relationships between tables are established using foreign keys to support the e-commerce functionality of the website.
- Unique constraints have been applied where appropriate such as `Category.slug` and `Story.slug` to prevent duplicate entries and support consistent routing.
- The Join tables (ProductQuantity, NutritionLabel) effectively manage many-to-many relationships between products and their sizes/prices as well as allowing additional attributes to be stored in relation to products independently.

##### Benefits of this design: 
- **Normalization**: avoids repetition of product rows for every size or nutrient metric
- **Scalability**: allows for easy addition of new sizes, nutrient metrics, and other attributes without altering the core product table structure
- **Accurate ordering**: ensures that each order line item accurately reflects the selected product size and price at the time of purchase
- **Auditable discounts**: single use discount tracking prevents misuse
- **Flexibility**: allows for easy modification and expansion of the database schema as the e-commerce platform evolves.
- **Marketing-ready**: supports content marketing strategies through origin stories linked to products.

### Web Marketing Strategies

#### Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)
When considering SEO optimisation for the Munch Crunch Pantry website, I have implemented several strategies to improve the site's visibility and ranking on search engines. 

The goals was to identify high-intent keywords relevant to the healthy wholefoods niche, particularly to those looking for natural, global wholefoods that are ethically sourced and of high quality.

The research process involved brainstorming topics, generating keyword ideas from these topics, research search behaviors on Google, creating a list of short and long-tail keywords, and analyzing competitors' keywords. In addition I have looked into keyword volume and competition using tools such as [wordtracker.com](https://www.wordtracker.com/), [Ubersuggest](https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/) and [Google Keyword Planner](https://ads.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/).

The keywords identified to be used throughout the application are based on the high relevance to the products offered, strong commercial intent, mix of difficulty levels and with a UK market focus. In addition some of the listed keywords link the brand values of ethical sourcing, sustainability and fairtrade practices.

The content on the website has been optimized by incorporating these keywords naturally into product descriptions, blog posts, meta tags, and other relevant areas of the site. This helps improve the site's relevance for search queries related to healthy wholefoods and increases the likelihood of attracting organic traffic from search engines.

#### Social Media Strategy
 For this project, I have created a social media business profile on Facebook to promote the Munch Crunch Pantry brand and engage with potential customers. The Facebook page serves as a platform to share updates, product launches, promotions, and educational content related to healthy wholefoods.

 This approach aligns with the needs of the target audience, who are likely to be active on social media and interested in health and wellness topics. By maintaining an active presence on Facebook, Munch Crunch Pantry can build brand awareness, foster a community of health-conscious individuals, and drive traffic to the e-commerce website.

 If the project were to be developed further, I would consider expanding the social media strategy to include other platforms such as Instagram and TikTok, which are also popular among health-conscious consumers. This would allow for a broader reach and more diverse content formats, such as visually appealing images and videos showcasing the products and their benefits.

#### Email Marketing Strategy
For this project I plan to implement a simple but effective email marketing strategy using the third-party service, [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/). This will allow me to create and manage a mailing list of customers and potential customers who are interested in receiving updates and promotions from Munch Crunch Pantry.

The project requirements dictate that only an option to sign up to a newsletter is to be implemented at this stage. However, if the project were to be developed further, I would consider expanding the email marketing strategy to include regular newsletters, promotional offers, and personalized recommendations based on customer preferences and purchase history.

## User Interface (UI) Design
### Colour Scheme
I used [color-hex](https://www.color-hex.com/) to compare and create a colour palette to apply to the creation of the logo of the Munch Crunch Pantry brand as well as the website design. The colours were chosen to represent health, vitality, and natural ingredients, aligning with the brand's focus on healthy wholefood snacks.

The colours have also been assessed using a contrast checker to ensure they pass all visibility checks and improve user experience. Please see the [Accessibility](#accessibility) section of of this document for results of the contrast checks.

### Typography
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) are used to apply Montserrat for page headings and Montserrat Alternates for body text. These fonts were chosen for their modern and clean appearance, which enhances readability and user experience.

### Imagery
Some of the images used throughout the site were sourced from [pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/). Images from this source are licensed for free use. I have also used [Sora](https://sora.chatgpt.com/explore) to create some AI images.

 [befunky.com](https://www.befunky.com/) has been used to resize the images.

### Wireframes
Wireframes have been created with desktop, tablet and mobile viewports in mind. I have used [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) to plan the layout and user flow of the application.

### Accessibility

During the designing and styling process of the website, I have kept in mind to aim to make the page as user friendly and accessible as possible. I have achieved this by:

* Semantic HTML -Use of descriptive alt attributes on the images used throughout the site. 
* Use of ARIA labels to improve accessibility for screen readers.
* Use of Bootstrap framework to ensure responsive design across different devices and screen sizes.
* Use of legible fonts and appropriate font sizes to enhance readability.
* Consistent navigation structure across all pages.
* Alt text for all images.
* I have checked the colour scheme used on the application using [colourcontrast.cc](https://colourcontrast.cc/) to assess the contrast of the colours used.

## Deployment

## Testing
### Automated Testing

The Munch Crunch Pantry project includes a comprehensive suite of automated tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of its core functionality. The tests cover various aspects of the application, including utility functions, views, forms, and webhook handling. The tests are implemented using Django's built-in testing framework, which provides a robust and efficient way to validate the application's behaviour.

```markdown
This output confirms that all 36 automated tests pass successfully, including
error-handling scenarios such as simulated email delivery failure.


>bash
python3 manage.py test

```


#### Basket App Tests
Most utility functions were tested indirectly through view, form, and webhook tests where they are used in critical flows such as checkout and order creation.

Utility tests were implemented for discount-handling logic to ensure pricing integrity during checkout.

The get_discount_amount() helper was tested to confirm valid discount codes are correctly applied, invalid or expired codes are safely rejected and removed from session data, and default values are returned when no discount is present.

This ensures discounts cannot be incorrectly applied or persisted, protecting order totals and checkout accuracy.

#### Checkout App Tests

The tests focus on the most critical parts of the purchase flow: creating Stripe PaymentIntents, caching checkout metadata, validating incoming webhooks, and ensuring successful payments reliably create orders and line items.

What was tested:
- Create Payment Intent (View)
  - Verified that if the basket is empty, `create_payment_intent` returns **HTTP 400** and **does not call Stripe** (`stripe.PaymentIntent.create` is mocked).

 This protects the checkout flow from invalid requests and prevents unnecessary Stripe API calls.

- Cache Checkout Data (View)
  - Confirmed `cache_checkout_data` returns **HTTP 200** and calls `stripe.PaymentIntent.modify()` exactly once (mocked), ensuring metadata such as `save_info` is correctly stored against the PaymentIntent before payment confirmation.

- Webhook Endpoint (View)
  - Tested that invalid JSON posted to the webhook returns **HTTP 400**, ensuring the endpoint fails safely.
  - Tested that valid webhook payloads are passed through Stripe’s event validation (`stripe.Webhook.construct_event` mocked), then correctly dispatched to the relevant handler method (e.g., `handle_payment_intent_succeeded`) on `StripeWH_Handler`.

- Webhook Handler (Business Logic)
  - Using a minimal `ProductQuantity` setup (Category → Product → Quantity → ProductQuantity), confirmed a `payment_intent.succeeded` event with basket metadata:
    - returns **HTTP 200**
    - creates exactly **one Order**
    - creates exactly **one OrderLineItem**
    - stores the correct email and line item quantity.
  - Tested resilience logic where the handler retries up to **5 times** to locate an existing order before creating a new one (`time.sleep` mocked and counted). This helps prevent duplicate orders during delayed/async webhook processing.

- OrderForm Validation
  - Confirmed the checkout form enforces required fields by verifying `full_name` is required and returns validation errors when missing.

**Mocking approach**
Stripe calls were mocked throughout the suite (`PaymentIntent.create`, `PaymentIntent.modify`, `Webhook.construct_event`, `Charge.retrieve`) so tests run quickly, deterministically, and without external API dependence, while still verifying that the integration points are called correctly.

#### Home App Tests
Automated tests were implemented to verify correct template rendering and robust error handling within the Home app.

Tests confirm that:

- The newsletter banner is correctly included in the base template and rendered on the home page, including the newsletter form markup and associated JavaScript file
- The contact view gracefully handles email-sending failures by displaying a user-friendly error message instead of crashing
- The contact page is re-rendered with the correct template when an email error occurs
- Email failure handling is tested using mocking to simulate an exception during the email send process, ensuring the application remains stable even when external services fail.

These tests help ensure a reliable user experience and defensive error handling across key user-facing pages.

#### Profiles App Tests
Automated tests were implemented for the UserProfile and ContactMessage models to ensure correct default behaviour, signal handling, and string representations.

Tests confirm that:
- A UserProfile is automatically created whenever a new user account is registered, via a post_save signal
- The UserProfile string representation correctly returns the associated user’s username
- ContactMessage instances default to a status of “new” upon creation
- Optional fields on ContactMessage (including user profile, order number, and email) can be left blank without causing errors
- The ContactMessage string representation outputs a clear, readable summary used in the admin interface

These tests help ensure reliable user profile management and safe handling of customer contact submissions throughout the application.

#### Reviews App Tests
The Review model is covered by automated tests to ensure correct default behaviour, data integrity, and custom query logic.

Tests confirm that:
- Default fields are set correctly on creation, including moderation status and timestamps
- The model’s string representation outputs a clear, user-friendly format used in the frontend
- Each user can submit only one review per product, enforced via a database-level unique constraint
- The approved_for_product() helper method returns only approved reviews for a given product

All tests use a minimal valid Product instance and Django’s built-in user model to reflect real application behaviour while keeping tests lightweight and maintainable.

#### Stories App Tests
Automated unit tests were implemented for the Story model to ensure its core behaviour, field constraints, and metadata function correctly. These tests help maintain data integrity, support predictable application behaviour, and prevent regressions as the project evolves.

- Default Field Values
    - Confirms that newly created stories are unpublished by default (is_published = False).
    - Verifies that the created_at timestamp is automatically populated when a story is created.
- String Representation
    - Ensures the __str__() method returns the story’s title.
    - This provides clear, human-readable object labels within the Django admin interface and during debugging.
- Slug Generation and Persistence
    - Verifies that a URL-friendly slug is automatically generated from the story title when no slug is provided.
    - Confirms that an existing slug is preserved and not overwritten if the title is later changed, ensuring stable URLs.

- Model Ordering
    - Validates that stories are ordered alphabetically by title by default, as defined in the model’s Meta.ordering configuration.
- Required Field Validation
    - Confirms that the origin_country field is mandatory.
    - Verifies that attempting to save a story without an origin country fails validation, enforcing consistent and complete data entry.

#### Products App Tests
I created automated unit tests for the products app (models and constraints) and run them using python3 manage.py test products to ensure data integrity and model behaviour remain correct as the project evolves.

The tests cover:
- Category model string representation
- Product model string representation
- Quantity model string representation
- ProductQuantity model string representation and unique_together constraint
- NutritionMetric model string representation
- NutritionLabel model string representation and unique_together constraint

They ensure that the models behave as expected and that data integrity is maintained through unique constraints. In addition these checks are repeatable as the project develops further. The full directory of products have not been included in the early stages and as more products are added, the integrity of the data entered in relation to products can be verified through the same tests.
